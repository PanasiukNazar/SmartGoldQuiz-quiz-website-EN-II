                        website, conducting our business, or servicing you.
                        These providers are obligated to maintain the
                        confidentiality of your information and are prohibited

                        the acquiring company. We will notify you of any such
                        change and provide you with options regarding your
                        information.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Legal Requirements</h3>
                    <p>
                        We may disclose your personal information if required to
                        do so by law or in response to valid requests by public
                        authorities. This includes sharing information to
                        protect our rights, property, or safety, and that of our
                        clients and others.

                    <h2>Data Security</h2>
                    <p>
                        We take the security of your personal information
                        seriously and implement appropriate technical and
                        organizational measures to protect it from unauthorized
                        access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. While we
                        strive to protect your personal information, we cannot
                        guarantee its absolute security, and we encourage you to
                        take steps to safeguard your data, such as using secure
                        passwords and not sharing your login information.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
                    <h3>1. Access and Correction</h3>
                    <p>
                        You have the right to access the personal information we
                        hold about you and request corrections if necessary. If
                        you believe that any information we have is inaccurate
                        or incomplete, please contact us, and we will promptly
                        update it.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Deletion</h3>

                        You may request the deletion of your personal
                        information from our systems. We will comply with such
                        requests, subject to any legal obligations to retain
                        certain data.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Restriction of Processing</h3>

                        You have the right to request that we restrict the
                        processing of your personal information under certain
                        circumstances, such as if you contest the accuracy of
                        the data or object to our processing activities.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4. Data Portability</h3>
                    <p>
                        You have the right to request a copy of your personal
                        information in a structured, commonly used, and
                        machine-readable format. This allows you to transfer
                        your data to another service provider if desired.
                    </p>

                    <h3>5. Objection to Processing</h3>
                    <p>
                        You may object to the processing of your personal
                        information for direct marketing purposes or any other
                        purpose based on legitimate interests. We will honor
                        your request unless we have compelling legitimate
                        grounds for the processing.
